### Project Overview
**Project Name:** Lem-in: Digital Ant Farm

**Objective:**
To develop a Go program that simulates a digital ant farm by finding the quickest way to move ants from a starting room to an ending room through a network of tunnels and rooms. The program will read input from a file, validate the data, find optimal paths, and display each ant's movement step-by-step.

**Key Features:**
1. Efficient pathfinding to minimize moves.
2. Robust error handling for invalid input.
3. Clear output format for ant movements.
4. Unit tests to ensure reliability.

**Constraints:**
- Only standard Go packages allowed.
- Handle edge cases such as disconnected graphs, invalid input, and traffic jams.

### Core Concepts/Tools/Skills
To ensure the project is professional-grade, the following concepts, tools, and skills should be employed:

1. **Go Best Practices:**
   - Follow idiomatic Go conventions (e.g., proper naming, error handling).
   - Use Go’s `context` package for managing timeouts and cancellations.
   - Write clean, modular, and reusable code.

2. **Algorithms and Data Structures:**
   - Implement graph algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Dijkstra for pathfinding.
   - Use efficient data structures such as maps, slices, and queues to manage rooms, tunnels, and ant movements.

3. **Version Control:**
   - Use Git for source control, with a branching strategy (e.g., feature branches, pull requests).
   - Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages.

4. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests using Go’s `testing` package.
   - Include edge case tests and integration tests to ensure robustness.
   - Use `go fmt`, `go vet`, and `golint` for code quality checks.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Maintain a `README.md` with clear setup instructions, usage examples, and team contributions.
   - Use inline comments to explain complex logic where necessary.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Gracefully handle and log errors using Go’s error wrapping (`errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`).
   - Provide meaningful error messages for invalid inputs.

7. **Collaboration and Communication:**
   - Regular stand-ups to sync team progress.
   - Use a task management tool (e.g., Trello, Jira) to track progress.
   - Conduct code reviews to ensure consistency and quality.

8. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Profile and benchmark critical sections of the code using Go’s `pprof` and `testing` packages.
   - Optimize algorithms to handle large inputs efficiently.

9. **Clean Architecture:**
   - Maintain separation of concerns using the MVC pattern.
   - Use dependency injection where necessary to improve testability.

10. **Concurrency:**
    - Employ Go’s goroutines and channels to manage concurrent tasks if applicable (e.g., multiple ants moving simultaneously).

### Design Pattern
**Pattern Used:** MVC (Model-View-Controller)

1. **Model:**
   - **Purpose:** Represent rooms, tunnels, and ants.
   - **Components:**
     - `Room`: Struct with fields for name, coordinates, connections, and occupancy status.
     - `Tunnel`: Struct to represent links between rooms.
     - `Ant`: Struct with ID and current room.

2. **Controller:**
   - **Purpose:** Handle business logic and input validation.
   - **Components:**
     - Parse and validate input file.
     - Implement pathfinding algorithm (e.g., BFS or Dijkstra).
     - Manage ant movements and traffic control.

3. **View:**
   - **Purpose:** Format and display output.
   - **Components:**
     - Display initial input data.
     - Display ant movements step-by-step.
     - Log errors or validation issues.
